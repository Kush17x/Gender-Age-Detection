Gender-Age-Detection

NOTE--- This GitHub Repository does not contain all the files needed to sucessfully run the code. There are two more files that are needed but they were too large. So here's a link to a google drive folder that has everything you need to work it: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vzu7fQq0pEUv6Lec92KRmbKqEQGkKqGi?usp=sharing

Just a basic code using OpenCV & Python that will detect faces and assign the face with a gender and age.

It starts off by initializing the camera in order to actually give the computer a vision to see everything

Then it creates a blob and a rectangle by detecting the face. And from their it makes multiple predictions regarding whether the subject is male or female and it's age. 

After all that it displays the prediction that is most often seen in the predictions.
