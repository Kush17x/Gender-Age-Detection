# Gender-Age-Detection

NOTE--- This GitHub Repository does not contain all the files needed to sucessfully run the code. There are two more files that are needed but they were too large.

Just a basic code using OpenCV & Python that will detect faces and assign the face with a gender and age.

It starts off by initializing the camera in order to actually give the computer a vision to see everything

Then it creates a blob and a rectangle by detecting the face. And from their it makes multiple predictions regarding whether the subject is male or female and it's age. 

After all that it displays the prediction that is most often seen in the predictions.
